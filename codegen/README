How to Install the Code Generator

1. Locate AnTLR folder
2. Locate org/antlr/codegen inside AnTLR folder
3. Copy Perl5Target.class into this folder*
4. Copy Perl5.stg into org/antlr/codegen/templates/Perl5. Create this folder if it does not exist

* if the target classes end with .java, you need to copy Perl5Target.java and recompile AnTLR.
Otherwise, you can try to compile Perl5Target.java and copy the generated Perl5Target.class into
the AnTLR's codegen folder (where are located the .class)
