How to Install the Code Generator with AnTLRv3.2

1. Download AnTLRv3.2 from here http://www.antlr.org/download
2. Locate tool/src/main/java/org/antlr/codegen inside AnTLR folder
3. Copy Perl5Target.java into this folder*
4. Copy Perl5.stg into tool/src/main/resources/org/antlr/codegen/templates/Perl5.
Create this folder if it does not exist
5. Compile AnTLR using Maven**

* if the target classes end with .java, you need to copy Perl5Target.java and compile AnTLR.
Otherwise, you can try to compile Perl5Target.java and copy the generated Perl5Target.class into
the AnTLR's codegen folder, where are located the .class (not sure if works).

** Maven can be installed with MacPorts
